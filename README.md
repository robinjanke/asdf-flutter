# asdf-flutter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/oae/asdf-flutter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/oae/asdf-flutter)

[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) plugin for the [asdf version manager](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf). This includes both **flutter** and **dart**.

## Dependencies

- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/)

## Install

```
asdf plugin add flutter
```

## Configure

If you have problems with accessing to google, you can set the `FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL` environment variable to change it but structure must be same with Google. Default value is `https://storage.googleapis.com`.

## FVM support

[FVM](https://fvm.app/) is one of major version manager for Flutter.

asdf uses a `.tool-versions` file for auto-switching between software versions. To ease migration, you can have it read an existing `.fvm/fvm_config.json` or `.fvmrc` file to find out what version of Flutter should be used. To do this, add the following to `$HOME/.asdfrc`:

```
legacy_version_file = yes
```

## Troubleshooting

### VSCode

To fix the "Could not find a Flutter SDK" error, you can set the `FLUTTER_ROOT` environment variable in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:
```bash
export FLUTTER_ROOT="$(asdf where flutter)"
```

### Bad CPU type in executable

Because this plugin uses [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) you have to enable [Rosetta](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861) to be able to execute non arm optimized software.

Apple will prompt you to install Rosetta if you open a GUI application but not if you're using the terminal. Thus you have to enable Rosetta manually:

```bash
softwareupdate --install-rosetta
```



## Linux on ARM64 (aarch64)

Flutter does not publish prebuilt Linux ARM64 SDK archives. On Ubuntu and other Linux ARM64 systems, this fork installs Flutter from the official git repository instead of downloading an x64 archive.

Install this fork with:

```bash
asdf plugin add flutter https://github.com/robinjanke/asdf-flutter.git
```

If you already use the default plugin, remove it first:

```bash
asdf plugin remove flutter
asdf plugin add flutter https://github.com/robinjanke/asdf-flutter.git
```

On Ubuntu ARM64, install build dependencies before running `asdf install flutter`:

```bash
sudo apt install git curl unzip clang cmake ninja-build pkg-config libgtk-3-dev
```

The first install takes longer than a binary download because Flutter downloads the ARM64 Dart SDK and engine artifacts during `precache`.
